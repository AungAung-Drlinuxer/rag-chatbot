/**
 * Render harness for the right-hand "Knowledge sources" panel — screenshots it WITHOUT
 * logging in.
 *
 * WHY A HARNESS
 * The chat page is behind auth and a verification script must not sign in as anyone.
 * This renders the SAME component the app renders, on the SAME stylesheet, inside a
 * mock chat shell so the 336px aside is measured in the context it actually lives in.
 *
 * WHERE THE DATA COMES FROM (nothing here is invented)
 *   - Titles marked [kb_files] are the real seed articles in `backend/kb_files/`, and
 *     their excerpts are the real text of those files.
 *   - Titles marked [goldset] are the expected top-1 title fragments from
 *     `backend/scripts/eval_goldset.py` — real article titles the retriever is scored
 *     against.
 *   - The two rows sharing a page_id reproduce the retriever's real behaviour: it
 *     returns up to 2 chunks per article (`_cap_per_article`), so the same page_id
 *     legitimately appears twice in `meta.hits`.
 *   - `retrieval` numbers use the real shape of the SSE `meta.retrieval` payload.
 *
 * Usage (dev server only; not part of the shipped bundle):
 *   node scripts/sources_harness_shot.mjs
