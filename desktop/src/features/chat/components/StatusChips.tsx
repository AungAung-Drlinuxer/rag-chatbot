/**
 * StatusChips — the four compact health chips in the chat header.
 *
 * From the reference mockup (docs/design/chat-ui-reference.md): `APP OK` ·
 * `DB Connected` · `Vector DB Healthy` · `LLM Ready`.
 *
 * Every chip reports a REAL check from `GET /api/dashboard/health`, which runs live
 * dependency probes (a `SELECT 1`, a Redis PING, an Ollama HTTP call, an LLM key check)
 * and returns `{services: [{key, name, status, latency_ms, detail}], overall, down}`.
 * Nothing is inferred from config presence, and a chip whose service is missing from the
 * response renders as `—` rather than as healthy: an absent key means "not reported",
 * not "fine".
 *
 * The one composite is `Vector DB`: the vector store is pgvector INSIDE PostgreSQL, and
 * the vectors it holds are produced by the embeddings service, so that chip is healthy
 * only when both `postgres` and `ollama` are. Collapsing it to `postgres` alone would
 * call the vector DB healthy while embedding was down.
