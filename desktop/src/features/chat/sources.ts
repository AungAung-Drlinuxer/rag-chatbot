/**
 * sources.ts — grouping and score labelling for retrieved sources.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SHARED
 * The answer card ("Sources for this answer") and the right-hand panel list the SAME
 * retrieval result, and the reference mockup gives each entry the same two facts: how
 * many references collapsed into it, and the retrieval match range across them.
 * Deriving those twice is exactly how the two lists start disagreeing — the answer card
 * counted raw rows while the panel counted groups, so one answer read "7 references"
 * next to a list of four.
 *
 * WHAT A GROUP IS
 * The retriever deliberately returns up to 2 chunks per article (`_cap_per_article`)
 * and then expands each winner with its neighbours, so one page_id legitimately appears
 * more than once. Listing it once per chunk showed the reader the same article as two
 * separate sources. The FIRST occurrence is kept, which preserves rank order.
