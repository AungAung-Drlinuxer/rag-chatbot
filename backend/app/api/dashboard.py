# --- reporting window ----------------------------------------------------------

# A custom window is a real date range, not "the last N days": asking for March cannot be
# expressed as a day count, so the two series endpoints accept explicit start/end dates.
#
# Two things this fixes, both of which made the UI state something untrue:
#   1. `days` was capped at 30, so the "Last 90 days" preset silently returned 30 days.
#   2. The picker was not wired to the request at all — every window fetched 7 days.
