"""HTTP client for the standalone rerank-svc (Option A split).

Cluster-internal only: the URL is an in-cluster Service DNS
(http://rerank-svc:8080) — no external egress, air-gap safe.

Contract (see rerank-svc/app.py):
    POST /v1/rerank {query, documents[], top_k} → {results[{index, relevance_score}]}

Raises on any transport/error problem; app.rerank catches and falls back to
vector order so a degraded reranker never takes chat down.

    `docs` items only need a "content" key; truncation mirrors the local path
    (first 2000 chars) so local and remote modes score identically.

    v1.6.42 — RETRY. This used to be a single POST with the full 30s timeout and
    no retry. rerank-svc is HPA-scaled, so a scale-up event routes traffic to a
    pod that is still loading bge-reranker; one ReadTimeout then dropped the whole
    request to vector order, the confidence gate scored it as `caution`, and the
    user was told "I couldn't find information in the knowledge base" even though
    the answer WAS indexed and retrievable. That turned a transient pod restart
    into a wrong answer.

    Now: a short per-attempt timeout (so a slow pod fails fast instead of blocking
    the request for 30s) with up to 3 attempts and backoff. The caller still
    catches everything, so a genuinely dead reranker degrades exactly as before.
