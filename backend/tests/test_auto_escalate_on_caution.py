"""`auto_escalate_on_caution` — the setting must actually escalate.

The regression this guards: the setting was stored on `user_settings`, served by
GET /api/settings and typed in the frontend, and read by NO logic. A below-threshold
answer showed the caution banner and stopped there, so the human the setting promises
never saw the question. Every test here fails against that dead version — that is the
point.

`_node_tools` is the escalation trigger: it runs after the confidence gate, sees the
gate's own `decision`, and is what `_route_after_tools` reads to choose
approval-vs-END. So it is tested directly rather than through a full graph run — the
graph needs Postgres checkpoints, an LLM and an embedder, and none of that is what
this behaviour depends on.
